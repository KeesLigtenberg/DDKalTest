#  DDKalTest - interface between KalTest fitter and DD4hep based geometry

###########################################################################

  Re-implentation of some of the code in KalDet, now using the DDRec:Surface
  provided by a DD4hep based tracking geometry as input for the measurement
  surfaces needed in KalTest.
  Intersection calculation is currently done in aidaTT.
  Material effects use averaged material from the DDRec:Surface.

  Main classes:

  - cylindrical measurement layers (1D,2D):
    DDCylinderMeasLayer
    DDCylinderHit

  - planar measurement layers (1D,2D, along and orthogonal to z):

     DDParallelPlanarMeasLayer
     DDPlanarMeasLayer 
     DDDiskMeasLayer ( same as DDPlanarMeasLayer)
     DDPlanarHit

  - generic detector set up from a DD4hep based tracking model

    DDKalDetector

  - measurement layer base classes: handles material effects (E-loss and MSq)
    DDVMeasLayer

  --------
 | v01-00 |
  --------

 F.Gaede

  - fixed the sorting policy for zdisks -> major improvement in forward track fitting

   - crosscheck of energy loss from aidaTT commented out

     - added DDSurfaces::ISurface* surface() and some debug output

      - remove hard coded muon mass for track fits


  --------
 | v00-03 |
  --------

 F.Gaede

 - use new (faster) standalone helix intersection methods

 - workaround for hits that are smeared off the DDRec::surface in the
   old digitizer

 - added DDConeMeasLayer
 - fixed bug in energy loss and multiple scattering
   for non-planar surfaces ( compute normal at x'ing point)

- distinguish between zplanes, disks and generic planes for sorting policy

- switch back to use SurfaceHelper class in order to get
  all insensitive surfaces ( lost in SurfaceMap )
- fixed some compiler warnings
