###########################################################################

  Re-implentation of some of the code in KalDet, now using the DDRec:Surface
  provided by a DD4hep based tracking geometry as input for the measurement
  surfaces needed in KalTest.
  Intersection calculation is currently done in aidaTT.
  Material effects use averaged material from the DDRec:Surface.

  Main classes:

  - cylindrical measurement layers (1D,2D):
    DDCylinderMeasLayer
    DDCylinderHit

  - planar measurement layers (1D,2D, along and orthogonal to z):

     DDParallelPlanarMeasLayer
     DDPlanarMeasLayer 
     DDDiskMeasLayer ( same as DDPlanarMeasLayer)
     DDPlanarHit

  - generic detector set up from a DD4hep based tracking model

    DDKalDetector

  - measurement layer base classes: handles material effects (E-loss and MSq)
    DDVMeasLayer
